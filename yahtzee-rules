Once the player chooses to score, and we know the category exists, and is empty

If dice fulfill category rule:
    give correct number of points in that category

If dice don't fulfill category rule:
    give 0 points in that category

If you roll a yahtzee, then you have to score in the yahtzee category

If the yahtzee category already has a score, make it 'joker'
    If the yahtzee category has a score less than (max_bonus - 100)=250, add 100 to yahtzee category as bonus
