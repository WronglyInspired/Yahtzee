This folder is full of components and versions of my Yahtzee game, but the final game is called "yhtz.py"

My aim with this project was to re-create Electronic Yahtzee from scratch
to play on my Casio fx-9860GIII graphics calculator during maths class.

DEFINITELY READ WHERE THERE ARE '!' down the side!

======================================================================================================================

THE FINAL GAME FILE: yhtz.py =========================================================================================

TESTED & WORKS ON: ===================================================================================================
     - any PC that can run Python 1.9.4+
     - Casio fx-9860GIII graphics calculator

HOW TO PLAY YAHTZEE: =================================================================================================
     - look up the official rules online, basically 13 rounds where you roll dice and select best
       categories to score in and try to get highest points you can.
     - this game uses the Free Joker rule

!    SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT CATEGORIES:

     Upper Row:
     1 - Ones
     2 - Twos
     3 - Threes
     4 - Fours
     5 - Fives
     6 - Sixes

     Lower Row:
!    T - Triples (Three of a Kind)
!    Q - Quadruples (Four of a Kind)
     F - Full House (Three of one kind and Two of another)
     S - Small Straight (a run of 4 consecutive dice)
     L - Large Straight (a run of 5 consecutive dice)
     C - Chance
     Y - Yahtzee (all dice same)

HOW TO PLAY MY PYTHON VERSION: =======================================================================================

    UNDERSTANDING THE INTERFACE: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The interface will look like this when you start the game:

    1    ==YAHTZEE=====Scr:000   # title, total score
    2     123456 =000  lst:---   # upper row, upper row total, last round's score
    3     TQFSLCY   bst:-:00     # lower row, best play)
    4                            #
    5     [0] [0] [0] [0] [0]    # dice
    6                   roll:0   # roll count
    7    New rnd:                # input line

    The interface part-way through a game will generally look like this:

    1    ==YAHTZEE=====Scr:117  # title and total score
    2     123--6 =022  lst:025  # upper row (with Fours and Fives already filled in), upper row total, last round's score
    3     TQ-SLCY   bst:C:16    # lower row (with Full House already filled in), best play
    4                           #
    5     [4] [1] [1] [4] [6]   # dice
    6                   roll:1  # roll count
    7    Hld or Scr:            # input line

    Sometimes you may get an error, meaning your input is invalid in some way and
    will appear on the 6th line:

    6     <ctgy err>   roll:1  # error message, roll count
    7    Hld or Scr:            # input line

    And if you roll a yahtzee but have already scored a yahtzee, you may get a bonus,
    and the joker may be activated:

    1    ==YAHTZEE=====Scr:070  # title and total score
    2     1234-6 =000  lst:050  # upper row, upper row total, last round's score
    3     TQFSLC-   bst:Q:25    # lower row, best play
    4      {JOKER}  {BONUS}     # Joker, Yahtzee Bonus
    5     [5] [5] [5] [5] [5]   # dice
    6                   roll:3  # roll count
    7    Score:            # input line


    ENTERING INPUT: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!    - Once game has started, you will be prompted to "Entr to bgn: ", so press [EXE]
!    - When prompted "New rnd: ", press [EXE] to roll the dice
!    - When prompted to "Hld or Scr: "
!
!      - Option 1: HOLD DICE, which means typing in 5 characters, either '1' or '0'.
!        For every '0', the corresponding die will be re-rolled.
!        For example: if dice are [2] [4] [6] [5] [3], and you enter "10110", the 2nd
!        [4] and 5th [3] dice will be re-rolled but the 1st [2], 3rd [6], and 4th [5]
!        dice will stay the same (be held). You can HOLD DICE after your first and second roll.
!
!      - Option 2: SCORE, which means you have to select a category to score in.
!        To do this, simply enter the corresponding character for the category you want
!        to score in, seen on-screen.
!        For example, to score in Twos enter "2", and to score in Small Straight enter "s".
!        (Note: Entering letters can be done by pressing [ALPHA])
!
!    - When prompted to "Score: ", you must SCORE (see Option 2 above)

     ERROR MESSAGES: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     <ctgy err> means you have either selected a category that doesn't exist, or is already filled.
     You will have to select another category.

     <input err> means you have entered input that is invalid. If you are prompted to "Hld or Scr",
     make sure you have entered 5 characters of "1" and "0" if holding, or just 1 character
     if scoring.

     <joker err> means you are not following the correct rules for the joker. These rules follow
     the Free Joker rule.


HOW TO INSTALL on CALCULATOR: ========================================================================================
     1) Download yhtz.py onto your PC
     2) Connect calculator to computer using USB Mini-B cable
     (Next steps have tutorials online to assist with this, may differ form calculator to calculator)
     3) Select F1-USB Flash on calculator to allow file transfer
     4) Drag and drop yhtz.py from your PC's file explorer into the main D: disk location
     5) Wait till calculator has finished downloading, disconnect, and press exit when prompted

HOW TO RUN ON CALCULATOR: ============================================================================================
     1) Turn on calculator
     2) Press [Menu] button
     3) Select PYTHON and press [EXE]  OR  Press [S<->D](H) button
     4) Select yhtz.py, and press [F1](Run)

MAKING THE GAME: =====================================================================================================

Electronic Yahtzee is a handheld version of the game, and I wanted to adapt that for playing on a calculator, so I made
this program from scratch. You can see the Electronic Yahtzee interface reflected in my program, but I have made some
changes.

Some restrictions were that the program could only be 150 lines long and 127 characters wide to function on my
calculator. When printing to the console, I could only print 6 lines of 21 characters, and the 7th line had to be input.

I also could only represent each category with a short string. At first I opted to specify '+' for upper row categories
and '-' for lower row, so Threes would be '+3' and Three of a Kind '-3', but that would be too confusing for the user.
Instead I changed the Three of a Kind and Four of a Kind categories to Triples and Quadruples respectively, so I could
represent them with unique codes 'T' and 'Q'.

I first coded this to work for Python 3.10+ on my computer, but when I tried to play it on my calculator it threw all
kinds of errors. I found out my calculator was running an adapted MicroPython 1.9.4, which didn't support formatted strings,
enumerating or ordered dictionaries to name a few, which gave me a few headaches but I finally sorted out.

Yes my Computer Science teacher would have a fit seeing my PEP-8 violations but it had to be optimised ok

I stretched this project over a long time period but am happy to finally say it is completely finished :)
